### 📂 Projects & Work

- Many of my recent, high-impact projects are proprietary/private (not publicly visible on GitHub).  
- This repository contains selected personal projects, experiments, and utility libraries that showcase my approach to backend design, CI/CD, and observability.

### 🔎 What I’m focused on next

- Designing resilient **FinTech** workflows and payment pipelines.  
- Deepening practical knowledge of **Spring AI** and applying it safely in production services.  
- Adopting **serverless** patterns where they reduce operational overhead without sacrificing reliability.  
- Implementing **GraphQL** solutions that integrate cleanly with Spring (schema generation & code-first approaches).
